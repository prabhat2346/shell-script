Just spicing up the shell script above to delete older files but with logging and calculation of elapsed time

#!/bin/bash

path="/data/backuplog/"
timestamp=$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)    
filename=log_$timestamp.txt    
log=$path$filename
days=7

START_TIME=$(date +%s)

find $path -maxdepth 1 -name "*.txt"  -type f -mtime +$days  -print -delete >> $log

echo "Backup:: Script Start -- $(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M)" >> $log


... code for backup ...or any other operation .... >> $log
END_TIME=$(date +%s)
